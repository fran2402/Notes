#### Hertzian dipole
Consider a small dipole transmitter where $I\ll\lambda$

The driving current is a time varying sinusoidally with angular frequency
The vector potential of a magnetic field is given by $\vec{B}=\nabla\times\vec{A}$, where $$\vec{A}(x)=\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\iiint \vec{J}(x) \frac{e^{ik|x-x'|}}{|x-x'|}\,d^3x' \hspace{1cm} \vec{J}(x)=\frac{I_0}{q}e^{-i\omega t}$$
The current runs to $z=\pm\Delta l/2$ making everything but the $z$ component $0$
Integrating between the extremum points, $$\vec{A}_z=\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\frac{e^{-i(\omega t-kr)}}{r}I\Delta l$$
Giving the magnetic field to be $$\vec{B}_\phi=(\nabla\times\vec{A})_\phi=-\frac{\partial \vec{A}_z}{\partial r}\frac{\partial r}{\partial \rho}$$
and since $r^2=\rho^2+z^2$, the partial of $r$ wrt $\rho$ is $\rho/r=\sin\theta$. Thus the expression for the magnetic field is $$\boxed{\vec{B}_\phi=-\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\frac{e^{-i(\omega t-kr)}}{r^2}(ikr-1)I\Delta l\sin\theta}$$
For materials equation, the magnetic field intensity is given by $\vec{H}=\vec{B}/\mu_0$
Using Maxwell's equation to find the electric field, $$\nabla\times\vec{H}=\vec{J}+\epsilon_0\frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t}$$
Away from the current $\vec{J}=0$, the electric field is given by (knowing the solution is going to be a wave equation), $$\vec{E}=-\frac{1}{i\omega\epsilon_0}\nabla\times\vec{H}$$
Only the $\theta$ direction of the magnetic field intensity is non-zero, $$(\nabla\times\vec{H})_\theta=-\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial (r\vec{H}_\phi)}{\partial r}$$
Thus, the electric field is, applying the property that $k=2\pi/\lambda$, $$\boxed{\vec{E}_\theta=-i\sqrt{\frac{\mu_0}{\epsilon_0}}\frac{I\Delta l}{2\lambda}\frac{\sin\theta}{r}\left(1-\frac{1}{ikr}+\frac{1}{(ikr)^2}\right)e^{-i(\omega t - kr)}}$$

There are three scenarios, 
- $1/r$ $\rightarrow$ radiation field
- $1/r^2$ $\rightarrow$ induction field
- $1/r^3$ $\rightarrow$ static field

At large $r\gg\Delta l$, the $1/r$ dependance dominates, so $$\frac{|E|}{|H|}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu_0}{\epsilon_0}}$$

Now calculating the directional power per unit area in the far field by calculating the time averaged Poynting vector $\langle\vec{S}\rangle = 1/\mu_0 |\text{Re} (\vec{E}\times\vec{H})|$, giving, $$\langle\vec{S}\rangle=\sqrt{\frac{\mu_0}{\epsilon_0}} \left(\frac{I\Delta l}{2\lambda}\right)^2\frac{\sin^2\theta}{2r^2}$$
This radiation has a donut shaped pattern due to the $\sin^2\theta$ dependence
The power is given by $$\boxed{\langle\vec{P}\rangle=\iint\langle\vec{S}\rangle r^2\sin\theta\,dr\,d\theta=\frac{4\pi}{3}\sqrt{\frac{\mu_0}{\epsilon_0}} \left(\frac{I\Delta l}{2\lambda}\right)^2}$$
The length of a dipole is typically half a wavelength, because the standing wave is highest at the center when each half of the dipole is $\lambda/4$ long

#### Antenna power patterns
A normalized power pattern of a simple short dipole is $$P_n(\theta, \phi)=\frac{1}{P_\text{max}}P(\theta,\phi)$$
Power gain $G(\theta, \phi)$ is the power transmitted per unit solid angle divided by the power transmitted per unit solid angle from an isotropic antenna with the same total flux

Usually expressed in decibels $G(\text{dB})=10\log_{10}G$

For a lossless isotropic antenna, the conservation of energy requires the directive gain to be equal in all directions $$\langle G \rangle =\frac{\int G\,d\Omega}{\int d\Omega}=1$$and $\int d\Omega = 4\pi$.
Lossless antennas may radiate with different directional patterns, but cannot alter the total amount of energy radiated

>$$\Delta\Omega\approx\frac{4\pi}{G_\text{max}}$$

#### Effective collecting area
The recieving counterpart of the transmitting gain is the effective collecting area, defined as the product of the geometric area and the incident spectral power per unit area $$A_e=\frac{P_\nu}{S_\nu}$$
We can relate the effective area with the geomteric area $A_e=\nu_AA_g$
Any antenna with a single output measures only one polarization
Electric fields perpendicular to the antenna wires does not produces currents in the antenna
A pair of crossed dipoles are needed to collect the power from both polarizations
The total spectral power from all directions collected by the antenna is $$P_\nu=A_e\frac{S_\nu}{2}=\int A_e(\theta,\phi)\frac{B_\nu}{2}\,d\Omega=k_\text{B}T$$
Knowing that $B_\nu\approx2k_\text{B}T/\lambda^2$, giving the integral $$\int A_e(\theta,\phi)\,d\Omega=\lambda^2$$
>[!tip] Average collecting area 
>$$\langle A_e \rangle=\frac{\int A_e(\theta,\phi)\,d\Omega}{\int d\Omega}=\frac{\lambda^2}{4\pi}$$

For this reason, dipole antennas are used at long avelengths, where many dipoles would be needed to have a decent collecting area at short wavelengths

#### Reciprocity theorems
**Strong**: if a voltage is appllied to the terminals of the antenna and the current measures at the terminals of another antenna, then an equaal current will appear at the terminals of the first antenna if the same voltage is applied to the second one

**Weak**: The power pattern of an antenna is the same for transmitting and recieving $$G(\theta,\phi) =\frac{4\pi}{\lambda^2} A_e(\theta, \phi)$$
#### Antenna temperature
The power output per unit frequency from a receiving antenna $$T_A=\frac{P_\nu}{k_\text{B}}=\frac{A_eS}{2k_\text{B}}$$
$1\, \text{K}$ of antenna is equivelnt to small power and can be calibrated by irect comparison to noise loads
It can compare the source signal with reciever and atmospeheric noise 

**Beam solid angle**: The beam area is the solid angle through which all of the power radiated by the antenna would stream if powerr maintained its maimum value over the beam area and zero everywhere else

>[!tip] Beam solid angle
>$$\Omega_A=\int P_n(\theta,\phi)\, d\Omega$$

>[!tip] True antenna temperature
>$$T_A=\frac{A_e}{2k_\text{B}}\iint I_\nu(\theta,\phi) P_n(\theta,\phi)\, d\Omega$$
