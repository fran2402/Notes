#### Brightness and flux
**Specific intensity** $I_\nu$, is conserved along any ray in empty space
$$dE=I_\nu\cos\theta\, d\sigma\, d\Omega\, dt\, d\nu \hspace{7mm} \Rightarrow \hspace{7mm} I_\nu = \frac{dP}{\cos\theta\, d\sigma\, d\Omega\, d\nu}$$
Giving the total intensity $$I=\int_0^\infty I_\nu\, d\nu$$
![[Pasted image 20241117161228.png#invert_B|300]]

**Flux density** is the spectral power recieved by a detector per using projected area $$\frac{dP}{d\sigma\, d\nu}=I_\nu\cos\theta\, d\Omega$$
for on-axis sources where $\cos\theta \approx 1$, $$S_\nu = \int I_\nu (\theta, \phi)\, d\Omega$$
**Spectral luminosity** is total power per unit bandwidth radiated by a source at frequency $\nu$, $$L_\nu = 4\pi r^2 S_\nu$$
**Bolomteric luminosity** is the sum of the spectral luminosity over all frequencies $$L_\mathrm{bol}=\int L_\nu\, d\nu$$
#### Radiative transfer
In free space, the specific intensity $I_\nu$ of radiation is conserved along a ray path
The inifinitesimal probability of a photon being absorbed in a thin slab of thickness $ds$ is, $$dp_\nu=\kappa_\nu\, ds$$
The fraction of the specific intensity lost due to the absorption only is$$\frac{dI_\nu}{I_\nu}=-\kappa_\nu\, ds$$
Integrating to give,$$I_\nu(s_\mathrm{out}) = I_\nu(s_\mathrm{in})\exp\left(\int_{s_\mathrm{in}}^{s_\mathrm{out}} \kappa_\nu\, ds\right) = I_\nu(s_\mathrm{in})\exp\left(-\tau\right) $$

There is also some probability that a photon may be emitted within some volume, $$\epsilon_\nu = \frac{dI_\nu}{ds}$$

Note that $\kappa$ and $\epsilon$ are **not independent** when the emitting and absorbing medium is in thermodynamic equilibrium

>[!info] Kirchhoff's law for a system in thermodynamic equilibrium
>$$\frac{\epsilon_\nu (T)}{\kappa_\nu (T)}=B_\nu(T)$$

**Brightness temperature** is the temperature of an object with specific intensity would be if it is equivalent to a blackbody $$T_b(\nu)=\frac{I_\nu c^2}{2k_\mathrm{B}\nu^2}$$
Not a real temperature unless the object is optically thick
As the brightness above the atmosphere is low,$$I_\nu(0)=B_\nu(T_A)(1-e^{-\tau_A})$$
Thus giving the brightness temperature as a function of the zenith angle to be (using the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation): $$T_b=T_A(1-\exp(-\tau_Z\sec z))$$
Considering the general case at a positon $s$ of a midium with temperature $T$, 
$$T_b(s)=T_b(0)e^{-\tau_\nu(s)}+(1-e^{-\tau_\nu(s)})$$
#### Propagation of radio waves through a conducting medium
A plasma consists of an ionized gas of ions and free electrons that have no net charge
Cold plasma is when the thermal motions of the electrons are negligible

>[!info] Maxwell's equations
>$$\nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}$$
>$$\nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu_0\vec{J}+\mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial\vec{E}}{\partial t}$$
>Where, $$\vec{J}=\sigma\vec{E}$$

Remembering the wave equation, $$E(r,t)=E_0\exp(-i(\omega t-kr)) \hspace{7mm} \dot{E}(r,t)=-i\omega E(r,t)\hspace{7mm} \ddot{E}(r,t)=i^2\omega^2 E(r,t)$$
$$k^2=\mu_0\epsilon_0\omega^2+i\mu_0\sigma\omega, \hspace{10mm} \omega=i\frac{n_ee^2}{m_e\omega}$$
The dispersion has an imaginary term; defining the phaseand group velocity to be$$v_p=\frac{\omega}{k}=\frac{c}{\sqrt{\epsilon\mu}},\hspace{10mm}v_g=\frac{d\omega}{dk}$$
![[Pasted image 20241117155330.png#invert_B_C]]

Subsituting for $k=\alpha+i\beta$, the wave equation becomes,$$E(r,t)=E_0\exp{(-i(\omega t -\alpha r))}\exp{(-\beta r)}$$
Giving the plasma frequency,$$\omega_p=\sqrt{\frac{n_ee^2}{\epsilon_0m_e}}$$
Arrival time between two different frequencies is. $$\Delta \tau_D=\frac{e^2}{8\pi^2m_ec\epsilon_0}\left(\frac{1}{\nu_1^2}-\frac{1}{\nu_2^2}\right)\int_0^Ln_e(L)dL$$
By defining the dispersion measure as the integral, it can be used to estimate the electron density of the plasma, like in the ionosphere, the ISM in out galaxy or the cosmic electron density

#### Nyquist theorem and noise temperature
The noise from the resistor is constant in frequency but increases in amplitude

![[Pasted image 20241120123150.png#invert_B]]

Consider a resistor containing electrons, the velocity of electrons is then given by $$v=\sqrt{\frac{2k_\text{B}T}{m_e}}$$
The voltage is given by Ohm's law $V=IR$. As the particles are moving in random directions, the sum of $N$ particles grows by $\propto N^{1/2}$
The current that makes it through the resistor over some period of time $$I=\frac{dq}{dt}\propto\frac{ev}{L}\sqrt{n_eAL}$$
The resistance is given by $$R=\frac{L}{A\sigma_c}, \hspace{1cm} \sigma_c=\frac{n_ee^2\tau_c}{m_e}$$
Thus calculating the power to be $P=I^2R$, thus $P\propto k_\text{B}\Delta\nu$ at a high frequency cutoff

>For a single resistor the spectral power from the rms noise, explains the presence of Johnson noise in an electronic system

#### Radiation from an accelerated charge
**An accelerated charge emits radiation**, important for understanding the radiation from radio sources and the detection of radio waves with antennas

Consider stationary charfe at $t=0$, accelerated by a velocity for time $\Delta t$ and has a kink in the continous electric field lines

Considering the radial and tangential components of the magnetic field $$E_\theta=\frac{q}{r^2}\frac{dv}{dt}\frac{r\sin\theta}{c^2}\hspace{1cm}E_r=\frac{q}{r^2}$$
If there is no acceleration, there is no tangential field, $$E_\theta=\frac{qa\sin\theta}{rc^2}$$
>[!tip] Poynting flux
>$$\vec{S}=\frac{c}{4\pi}\vec{E}\times\vec{H}$$

For a plane wave (in cgs) $|\vec{E}|=|\vec{H}|$. The total power is emitted by integrating over all directions $$P=\int|\vec{S}|\,dA=\frac{q^2a^2}{4\pi c^2}\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^\pi \frac{\sin^2\theta}{r^2}r^2\sin\theta\,d\theta\,d\phi=\frac{2}{3}\frac{q^2a^2}{c^3}$$
This gives the **Larmor's formula**, describing the total power radiated by any accelerated charged particle

![[Pasted image 20241120123242.png#invert_B]]

The total energy is given by $$W=\int_{-\infty}^\infty P(t)\, dt$$
The frequency of the emitted pulse of radiation is determined by the variation of the electric field
