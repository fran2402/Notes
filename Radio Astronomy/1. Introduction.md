Radio astronomy is the study of radiation at frequences between $\nu = 10\, \mathrm{MHz} - 1\, \mathrm{THz}$
Observing window is constrained by atmospheric absorption/emission and refraction
- Charged particles in the ionosphere reflect radio back into space $<10\, \mathrm{MHz}$
- Vibrational transitions of molecules absorb radiation $>1\,\mathrm{GHz}$

>[!info] Effective refractive index of plasma of charged particles in the ionosphere
>$$n^2=1-\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}=1-\frac{\lambda^2}{\lambda_p^2}$$
>where, the plasma frequency is, $$\nu_p[\mathrm{Hz}]=8.97\times10^3\sqrt{\frac{N_e}{[\mathrm{cm^{-3}}]}}$$

- $\omega<\omega_p$: $n^2$ is negative, reflection
- $\omega>\omega_p$: $n^2$ is positive, refraction
- $\omega\gg\omega_p$: $n^2$ unity, reflection

#### High-frequency cut-off (absorption)

>[!tip] Mass absorption coefficient $k$
>$$ k_i = \frac{\sigma n_i}{r_i \rho_0} $$

>[!tip] Optical depth $\tau$
>$$\tau_i(\lambda, z_0) = \int_{z_0}^\infty n_i(z)\sigma\, dz = \int_{z_0}^\infty r_i(z) \rho_0(z) k_i(\lambda)\, dz$$

This gives then the attenuation of the incident ray of intensity $I_0$ recieved at altitude $z_0$ summed over all absorbing species to be $$I(z_0)=I_0\exp\left(-\sum_i \tau(\lambda, z_0)\right)=I_0e^{-\tau(z)}$$
The atmosphere is not completely transparent at radio wavelengths, meaning $\tau(z)$ varies with frequency.
- **Broadband**, dry air, almost independent of $\nu$
- **Molecular absorption** of $\mathrm{O}_2$ has rotational transitions that absorb radio waves between $52 - 64\, \mathrm{GHz}$
- **Hydrosols**, water droplets, suspended in clouds absorb radiation $\propto \lambda^{-2}$ 
- **Water vapor** emission line at $\approx 22\, \mathrm{GHz}$ is pressure broadened
	- Higher altitudes, move above water vapor level
	- Drier locations, less water vapor in ai
