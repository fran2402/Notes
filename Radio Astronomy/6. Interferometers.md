Correlating signals from different telescope to effectively increase $D$. to an arbitrary large value by increasing the telescope distances

##### Double slit experiment example
Constructive interference fringes occur when the path difference is an integer number of wavelengths, 
$$d\sin\theta=n\lambda$$
giving the spacing between fringes, $$\theta\sim\frac{\lambda}{d} $$
#### Two element interferometer
- Two identical telescopes observe the electric field of some source
- Radiation travels to one antenna with an extra distance, $b\cdot\hat s = b\cos\theta$ 
	- where $b$ is the baseline length and $\hat s$ is a unit vector in the source direction
- Can be expressed as **geometric delay**, $\tau_g = \vec b \cdot \hat s / c$ 

For *quasi-monochromatic* interferometer, the output voltage is $$V_1 = V\cos(\omega(t-\tau_g)) \hspace{1cm} V_2 = V\cos\omega t $$ The correlator ultiplies the voltages to give, $$V_1V_2 = \frac{V^2}{2}(\cos(2\omega t - \omega\tau_g) + \cos\omega\tau_g)$$
and the time average to remove the high frequency component to give, $$R=\langle V_1V_2 \rangle = \frac{V^2}{2}\cos\omega\tau_g$$
Uncorrelated noise does not correlate and is reduced
The output voltage $R$ varies sinusoidally with changes in source direction, giving fringes, where the fringe phase is $$\frac{d\phi}{d\theta} = 2\pi\frac{b}{\lambda}\sin\theta, \hspace{1cm}\phi=\omega\tau_g=\frac{\omega}{c}b\cos\theta$$
