Correlating signals from different telescope to effectively increase $D$. to an arbitrary large value by increasing the telescope distances

##### Double slit experiment example
Constructive interference fringes occur when the path difference is an integer number of wavelengths, 
$$d\sin\theta=n\lambda$$
giving the spacing between fringes, $$\theta\sim\frac{\lambda}{d} $$
#### Two element interferometer
- Two identical telescopes observe the electric field of some source
- Radiation travels to one antenna with an extra distance, $b\cdot\hat s = b\cos\theta$ 
	- where $b$ is the baseline length and $\hat s$ is a unit vector in the source direction
- Can be expressed as **geometric delay**, $\tau_g = \vec b \cdot \hat s / c$ 

For *quasi-monochromatic* interferometer, the output voltage is $$V_1 = V\cos(\omega(t-\tau_g)) \hspace{1cm} V_2 = V\cos\omega t $$ The correlator ultiplies the voltages to give, $$V_1V_2 = \frac{V^2}{2}(\cos(2\omega t - \omega\tau_g) + \cos\omega\tau_g)$$
and the time average to remove the high frequency component to give, $$R=\langle V_1V_2 \rangle = \frac{V^2}{2}\cos\omega\tau_g$$
Uncorrelated noise does not correlate and is reduced
The output voltage $R$ varies sinusoidally with changes in source direction, giving fringes, where the fringe phase is $$\frac{d\phi}{d\theta} = 2\pi\frac{b}{\lambda}\sin\theta, \hspace{1cm}\phi=\omega\tau_g=\frac{\omega}{c}b\cos\theta$$
#### Extended sources
#### Visibility function
The visibility function is the Fourier transform of the brightness distribution of the source, $$V(u,v) = \iint I(l,m)e^{-2\pi i(ul+vm)}dldm$$
To make images of the sky that are closes to the true surface brightness we need a completely sampled uv plane
Three ways to achieve better sampling in the Fourier plane:
- Add more antennas
- Add more frequencies
- Add more time

**Aperture synthesis** is the most common method used to increase the sampling in the uv plane, using the Earth rotation to change the projected baseline length and direction

**Amplitude** and **phase** of the visibilities as a function of baseline length are dependent on the structure of the source

#### Delay beam
The response of an interferometer to a quasi-monochromatic wave is, $$V_\nu=\int I_\nu (\hat s) \exp\left(-2\pi i\nu\left[\vec b \cdot \hat s/c\right]\right)\,d\Omega$$\For a constant source brightness over a small bandwith $\Delta\nu$ centered at frequency $\nu_c$, the response is, $$\begin{align} V &= \int \left[(\Delta\nu)^{-1} \int_{v_c-\Delta\nu/2}^{v_c+\Delta\nu/2} I_\nu(\hat s) \exp\left(-2\pi i\nu\left[\vec b \cdot \hat s/c\right]\right)\,d\nu \right]\,d\Omega\\
&= \int I_\nu (\hat s) \exp\left(-2\pi i\nu_c\left[\vec b \cdot \hat s/c\right]\right)\,\text{sinc}\left(\Delta\nu \left[\vec b \cdot \hat s/c\right]\right) \,d\Omega\end{align}$$
Three different beams need to be recovered,
- **Primary beam**, due to the power pattern of the individual antennas
- **Synthesis beam**, due to the sinusoidal response of the two elements
- **Delay beam**, due to the attenuation produced by the finite bandwith of the observation

Effect of the delay beam attenuation as a function of position can be connected in any direction, by defining a delay/phase center
Defined by adding a phase shift in the correlation, or by introducing an extr path length in the cable connecting the antennas (compensating delay)

>[!tip] Coherence time
>$$\tau = (\Delta\nu)^{-1}$$
>TIme that the incoming waves can be considered coherent, their average phase is known

The delay compensation can only be exact in one direction, so the angular radius of the usable FOV is determined by the variation of $\tau_g$ with offset $\Delta\theta$ from direction $\hat s$ 

$$\Delta\theta\Delta\nu\ll\theta_s\nu$$
causing **bandwith smearing** for wide field images
Averaging channels increases the $\Delta\nu$ of each visibility averages in the radial direction of the uv plane
Results in
- objects being stretched in the sky surface brightness plane
- lowering of the measured surface brightness

Correlator averaging time of the visibilities must be short enough that the Earth's rotation will not move the source by more than $\theta_b \approx \lambda/b$, in the inferometer plane

#### Point source sensitivity
A key parameter for any measuring device is a measure of the sensitivity
For an interferometer, the sensitivity can be calculated using the radiometer equation, but must also inlude the number of antennas used
$$\sigma_{S_\nu} = \frac{2k_\text{B}T_\text{sys}}{A_e\sqrt{\Delta\nu\tau N(N-1)}}$$
where $N$ is the number of antennas
**Extended source sensitivity:** In reality, an interferometer is sensitive to structure on some angular-scale, so the sensitivity in the radiometer equation is surface brightness
At radio wavelengths, the brightness temperature is a convenient measure of surface brightness, $$\sigma_{T_b} = \frac{\sigma_{S_\nu}}{\Omega_A}\frac{\lambda^2}{2k}$$
where $\Omega_A$ is the angular area of the source, $$\Omega_A = \frac{\pi\theta_s^2}{4\ln 2}$$
