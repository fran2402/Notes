#### Reflector antenna basics
**Paraboloidal reflectors**: to be useful at short wavelengths an antenna must have a collecting area smaller than $\lambda^2/4\pi$ of an isotropic antenna and provide a much larger angular resolution
Impractical at short wavelengths, most radiotelescopes use large reflectors to collect and docus power onto simple feed antennas
#### Focal length
Plane wave fronts from a distant point source arrive perpendicular to the $z$ axis
From a wavefront at height $h$ above the vertex, the ray path lengths and up to the focal point at $z=f$ must be the same

**Focal length** is related to the diameter of a reflector by the focal ratio $f/D$
If it is too high the support structure is too large, if too small fov becomes limited

**Paraboloidal reflectors** are useful because:
- The effective collecting area can approach geometric area
- SImpler than an array of dipoles
- Can change the feed antenna to work over a wide frequency range

#### Far-field distance
The distance that the recieved waves can be considered planar

Defined to have $\Delta=\lambda/16$
$$R=\frac{\Delta}{2}+\frac{D^2}{8\Delta}\approx\frac{2D^2}{\lambda}$$
If $R>R_f$ path length errors will introduce significant phase errors in the waves coming from the off-axis component of our reflector. reducing the effective area and the antenna power pattern 

#### Aperture illumination pattern
For a parabolodial reflector of diameter $D$, the aperture is a plane circle with diameter $D$

>$$f(\hat{\xi})=\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(\nu)e^{-i2\pi\xi}\,d\nu$$

Normalized farfield electric field pattern for a 1D aperture with a constant illumination is a sinc function, $$P_n(l)=\text{sinc}^2\frac{\theta D}{\lambda}$$
The central peak of the power pattern is the **main beam**, and secondary peaks **side-lobes**
The main beam is contained within the first minimum, where power goes to 0, and so its angular size (zero-poer beam width) is $$\theta_\text{ZPBW}=\frac{2\lambda}{D}$$
The main beam is normally defined by half power beam width, $$\theta_\text{HPBW}\approx0.89\frac{k\lambda}{D}$$ where $k$ is dependent on the illumination pattern
#### Aperture efficiency
Not all of the aperture is used for observation, decreasing effective area and changes the side-lobe structure and the angular resilution of the aperture $$\eta_A=\frac{\text{max}(A_e)}{A_\text{geom}}\hspace{1cm}\eta_A=\eta_{sp}\eta_t\eta_b\eta_s$$
$\eta_A<1$ because:
- **Feed spillover $\eta_{sp}$:** radiation falls outside of the antenna area
- **Feed illumination taper $\eta_t$:** outer parts of the antenna are illumiated less
- **Aperture blockage $\eta_b$:** frontend feed blocks part of radiation path
- **Surface errors $\eta_s$:** random errors on the parabolic shape introduce phase changes

Illumination taper, radio telescopes with practical feeds and circular apertures tend to have a gaussian illumiation pattern $$g(u)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp\left(-\frac{u^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$$
Gaussian tapering (grating) reduces $\eta_A$ by 30% and the first side-lobe level by and order of megnitude

Reflector surface efficienty, power gain of an actual reflector divided by the power gain of a perfectly paraboidal reflector of same size and illumination
Caused by:
- Manufacturing errors
- Thermal changes across the antenna
- Deformation due to gravity
- Strong winds

Surface errors $\epsilon$ produce phase errors $\delta$ in the incoming waves and therefore frequency dependent, $$\delta=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}(2\epsilon)$$
where the factor of 2 comes from reflection

>$$\frac{P(\delta)}{P_0} =\eta_s=\exp\left[-\left(\frac{4\pi\sigma}{\lambda}\right)^2\right]$$

Aperture blockage, dependent on area lost due to the feed/sub reflector $$\eta=\left(1-\frac{\text{effective blocked area}}{\text{total area}}\right)^2$$
#### Antenna mount and feed position

**Equatorial mount,** aligned to the polar axis, rotation set by RA, Dec axis moved to set the declination
**Alt-Az mount,** two moving axis that are fiex relative to the Earth
