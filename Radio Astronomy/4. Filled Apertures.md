#### Reflector antenna basics
**Paraboloidal reflectors**: to be useful at short wavelengths an antenna must have a collecting area smaller than $\lambda^2/4\pi$ of an isotropic antenna and provide a much larger angular resolution
Impractical at short wavelengths, most radiotelescopes use large reflectors to collect and docus power onto simple feed antennas
#### Focal length
Plane wave fronts from a distant point source arrive perpendicular to the $z$ axis
From a wavefront at height $h$ above the vertex, the ray path lengths and up to the focal point at $z=f$ must be the same

**Focal length** is related to the diameter of a reflector by the focal ratio $f/D$
If it is too high the support structure is too large, if too small fov becomes limited

**Paraboloidal reflectors** are useful because:
- The effective collecting area can approach geometric area
- SImpler than an array of dipoles
- Can change the feed antenna to work over a wide frequency range

#### Far-field distance
The distance that the recieved waves can be considered planar

Defined to have $\Delta=\lambda/16$
$$R=\frac{\Delta}{2}+\frac{D^2}{8\Delta}\approx\frac{2D^2}{\lambda}$$
If $R>R_f$ path length errors will introduce significant phase errors in the waves coming from the off-axis component of our reflector. reducing the effective area and the antenna power pattern
