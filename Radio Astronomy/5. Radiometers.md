#### Basics
Radiometers, a device for converting recieved EM radiation into a measurable quantity, usually spectral power

Noise temperature $T_N$, $$T_N=\frac{P_\nu}{k_\text{B}}$$
System toise temperature $T_\text{sys}$, the temperature equivalent to the total noise power rom all sources referenced to the output of an ideal receiver connected to the output $$P_\text{sys}=\sum_i P_i\hspace{1cm}T_\text{sys}=\sum_iT_i$$
All receivers generate noise, minimized by cooling the receiver to cryogenic temperatures
