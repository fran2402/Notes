#### Basics
Radiometers, a device for converting recieved EM radiation into a measurable quantity, usually spectral power

Noise temperature $T_N$, $$T_N=\frac{P_\nu}{k_\text{B}}$$
System toise temperature $T_\text{sys}$, the temperature equivalent to the total noise power rom all sources referenced to the output of an ideal receiver connected to the output $$P_\text{sys}=\sum_i P_i\hspace{1cm}T_\text{sys}=\sum_iT_i$$
All receivers generate noise, minimized by cooling the receiver to cryogenic temperatures
#### Band limited noise and the Nyquist-Shannon theorem
**Band limited noise:** voltage at the output of a radio telescope is the sum of the noise voltages for many independent random contributions
The central limit theore states that the amplitude distribution of such noise is nearly gaussian

**Nyquist-Shannon:** any signal of limited bdandwith and duration can be represented by a minimum of $2N$ independent samples

#### Simple total-power radiometer
Measures time-averaged power of the input noise in some well-defined radio frequency range $$\nu_\text{RF}\pm\frac{\Delta\nu_\text{RF}}{2}$$
The fractional bandwidth is defined as $\Delta\nu_\text{RF}/\nu_\text{RF}$

The simplest consists of four stages
- Ideal lossless bandpass filter that passes input noise only in the desired frequency range
	- After passing through an input filter, the noise voltage is no longer completely random
	- Looks more like sine wave frequency whose amplitudde varies randomly on time scales $\tau=\Delta\nu_\text{RF}^{-1}>\nu_\text{RF}^{-1}$
- Output voltage is proportional to input power
	- For a narrowband input voltage, $V_\text{out}=\cos^22\pi\nu_\text{RF}t$
	- The mean value is the average power of the input signal
- Integration that smooths over rapidly fluctuating detector output
	- Rapidly varying component at frequencies near $2\nu_\text{RF}$
	- Envelope varies on time scales that are shorter than average signal power
	- Unwanted rapid variations can be suppressed by taking the arithmetic mean of the detected envelope
- Voltmeter to measure and record the smoothened voltage

#### Radiometer equation
The ability to measure a signal is dependent on the noise properties of the omplete system although this is typically domiated by Johnson noise within the receiver

Variations estimated by, 
- TIme travel
- Uncertainty in the noise power
- The rms error in average of $N\gg 1$ indepenent samples is reduced

$$\sigma_T=\frac{\sqrt{2}T_\text{sys}}{\sqrt{N}}\approx\frac{T_\text{sys}}{\sqrt{\Delta\nu_\text{RF}\tau}}$$
The signal to noise ratio of the target source is $$\frac{S}{N}=\frac{T_\text{source}}{\sigma_T}=\frac{T_\text{source}}{T_\text{sys}}\sqrt{\Delta\nu_\text{RF}\tau}$$
>[!tip] System equivalent flux density
>$$\text{SEFT}=\frac{2k_\text{B}T_\text{sys}}{A_e}$$

Good way to compare the sensitivity of telescopes
$$\sigma_{S_\nu}=\frac{\text{SEFD}}{\sqrt{\Delta\nu_\text{RF}\tau}}$$

#### Coherent total power radiometer
Typical coherent receivers, most are heterodyne receivers, mixer after an amplifier multiplies the signal by a since wave

**Amplifiers** increase the signal recieved, requiered to 
- have low internal noise
- have large fractional bandwidths
- linerarity
- gain stability

**Amplifier gain**, radio between input and output power $$P_\text{out}=k_\text{B}T\Delta\nu G$$
Total gain is then given by $$G=\prod_iG_i$$
As each of the requirements is not perfect, the total system noise is tominated by the first amplifier $$T_\text{eq}=T_1+\frac{T_2}{G_1}+\frac{T_3}{G_1G_2}+...$$
**Mixers**, change the frequency of the recieved emission, useful for:
- Avoids feedback of amplified signals back into the front end
- Can choose frequency that is easier to be dealt with

**Filters** limit the frequency passes through a system or change the phase of the input
**Digitalization** to convert analog to digital
- A/D converter,the amount of information that can be sent through the system is limited
- Number of bits used to describe the analog input needs to be as low as possible without loss of information
- Sampling must satisfy Nyquist-Shannon

#### Receiver calibration
Measuring receiver temperature is needed to determine the noise power scale at the receiver input
For coherent receiver systems, this requires the noise temperature increment at the receiver input ot be related to the receiver output power
This is done by connecting two or more known power sources, typiclaly matched resistive loads of known temperature to the system
$$T_R=\frac{T_H-yT_L}{y-1}$$
**$T_\text{sys}$ calibration**, need a measurement of the total system temperature to establish the noise change due to the target sources
Done by firing a noise diode of known power into the system and measuring the total power received
- Used by single dish telescopes and some interferometric arrays
