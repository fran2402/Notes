**Subsurface wealth**
- Inuit organized themselves into small, seasonably-mobile bands
- The transition into sedimentary life in the 20th century was arguably traumatic
- Nunavut has untapped mineral wealth
- Mining began soon after the establishment of Nunavut
- Full mineral production begins when the deposits are deemed large enough to justify excavaiting costs
**Gahcho Kue Mine**
- Diamond mine started in 2016
- Efforts made to integrate indigenout peoples into decision-making
- Emphasized environmental sustainability and local engagement
**Nunavut mining**
- Gold most common sought-after material
- Baffinland negotiated 25% employment rate Inuit quota; never reached
- Meadowbank had 41% peak, remained steady
- Intersection between traditional knowledge and resource extraction is poorly undersood
- All mining operations require archeological surveys
	- A network of inuksuit near Baffinland discovered
	- Concerns have been appropriately mitigated in project areas
- They identify mining as a generational occupation (like with hunting)
