**Whaling**
- Important in Dutch history
- Important in history of the Arctic Center, under former director 20 years of whaling research

**Early whaling**
- Basque first commercial whaling
- Started in the 12th century
- 1553: company of London merchants and couriers were financing a voyage to find the North East passage
- 1566: Dutch also began trade at White Sea area
- 17th century: population growth, expanding industries
	- Oil and fats from rapeseed, hemp and limeseed
	- Higher focus on food production than using those for oil

**Walrus use**
- Blubber oil
- Valuable tusks
- Skin for machine belts

**Greenland right whale**
- $60\,\text{cm}$ of blubber
- Slow swimmer, $2-5\,\text{km}\,\text{h}^{-1}$
- 1606: 700 walrus killed in 6 hours, $22\,\text{t}$ of oil
- 1611: first whaling expedition with 2 ships to Spitsbergen, hiring Basque whalers
- Rapid growth in whaling grounds, strong competition 
	- 1613: The English confiscate Dutch ships

**Muscovy company**
- First started with walrus hunt and whaling
- 1555 - 1917, first aimed to trade with China

**Noordsche Compagnie**
- 1614 - 1642, cartel for whaling 
- Founded by several Dutsch cities
- Trading area from Davis straight to Nova Zeml—åa

**Agreement with Muscovy and Noordsche Companies**
- Agreement where to hunt, competition costs too much money

**Whaling risks**
- Scurvy
- Battling whaling grounds
- Navigating in ice conditions and uncharted waters

**Smeerenburg**
- Successful hunt of reindeer
- Collected scurvy grass
- A lot of exercises to stay fit, strong discipline

**End of Dutch whaling supremacy**
- After 1730: English and French took over
	- Had more finacning than the Dutch

**Consequences**
- Whales went almost extinct
- Made zooplankton available in large quantities
- Surplus of plankton consumed by birds and fish
- Slow bowhead whale recovery
	- Do not breed until 25 years old
	- Live 200 years
- Whales slowly recovering

**Antarctic whaling**
- Invention of the harpoon gun
- Combined with sgteam whaling, possible to kill a fast moving fin whale
- Began enmasse in 1904 with building a whale processing station on South Georgia

**Over-exploitation concerns**
- Conservation measuresin 1925
- International Whaling Committe
	- Signed in 1946
	- Proper conservation of whale stocks
	- Ensure that hunted whale populations are maintained at healthy levels
	- Enable native people to hunt whales at levels that are appropriate to their cultural traditions
- 1986: Moratorium commercial whaling
	- Uncertainty over whale numbers
	- Set catch limits for aboriginal substenence whaling
	- Todat the Commission also works to understand and address a wide range of non-whaling threats
		- Entanglement, ship strike, marine debris, climate change, etc.
