- **Historical Context**:
    - Green colonialism in the Arctic has roots in broader patterns of colonialism and resource extraction.
    - In the early 20th century, the Arctic became a focal point for southern governments and industries due to its resource potential.
    - Economic activities like mining, oil and gas exploration, and renewable energy projects began in the region, often without consulting Indigenous peoples

- **1970s Shift**:
    - This period marked a transition from disciplinary power structures to a governmentality-based approach for Arctic Indigenous communities.
    - While it appeared to grant more autonomy to Indigenous groups, it also represented a new form of control to make their communities more "productive" from the state's perspective.

- **1990s and Sustainable Development**:
    - With the rise of the global sustainable development movement, renewable energy projects like wind farms became popular in the Arctic.
    - These projects were often framed as environmentally friendly alternatives to fossil fuels but frequently overlooked the impact on Indigenous communities, especially reindeer herding practices among the Saami people.

- **Arctic Council and International Cooperation (1996)**:
    - The establishment of the Arctic Council fostered international cooperation, with the involvement of Arctic Indigenous communities.
    - However, Indigenous voices, despite being included, did not always translate into equitable decision-making power or the protection of their rights amid increasing economic development in the region.

- **Overall Issue**:
    - Indigenous lands in the Arctic were increasingly exploited for renewable energy projects, often under the guise of environmental protection.
    - The development ignored or marginalized traditional Indigenous land use practices and their rights.

- **Green Colonialism in the Arctic**:
    
    - A critical lens for analyzing environmental policies and projects in climate-vulnerable regions, such as the Arctic.
    - Focuses on how environmental initiatives, particularly related to renewable energy and resource extraction, can marginalize Indigenous communities and perpetuate inequities.
- **Russia’s Approach**:
    
    - **Dual Focus**: Russia emphasizes both environmental protection and resource exploitation.
        - As chair of the Arctic Council (2021-2023), Russia called for protecting the Arctic ecosystem and addressing climate change.
        - However, this rhetoric conflicts with Russia's extensive development plans, including oil and gas extraction, raising questions about the sincerity of its environmental commitments.
    - **Indigenous Rights**: Russia has been criticized for a top-down approach, with limited inclusion of Indigenous communities in decision-making processes regarding Arctic development.
    - **Resource Exploitation**: Russia views the Arctic primarily as a resource-rich region for economic development, often prioritizing resource extraction over environmental concerns.
    - **Climate Change Mitigation**: Russia has been slow to implement renewable energy projects in the Arctic, framing fossil fuel extraction as necessary for economic growth despite its environmental impact.
- **Western States’ Approach**:
    
    - **Environmental Protection**: Western countries emphasize environmental protection and sustainable development in the Arctic.
        - They promote renewable energy projects and enforce stricter environmental regulations.
        - However, critics argue that even these "green" initiatives can still perpetuate inequities, particularly for Indigenous communities, thus aligning with green colonialism.
    - **Indigenous Rights**: Western states generally prioritize Indigenous involvement in Arctic decision-making, with frameworks like human security promoting societal security in the region.
    - **Resource Exploitation**: While Western countries also engage in resource extraction, they tend to balance this with stronger environmental protections and sustainable development goals.
    - **Climate Change Mitigation**: Western states actively promote renewable energy projects as part of their broader climate change mitigation efforts.
- **Key Differences in Approach**:
    
    - **Indigenous Participation**:
        - Western states generally place greater emphasis on consulting Indigenous communities, while Russia follows a more top-down model.
    - **Environmental and Resource Development Balance**:
        - Western policies aim to balance resource extraction with environmental protection, whereas Russia prioritizes resource exploitation, with environmental concerns often secondary.
    - **Climate Change Strategies**:
        - Western states are more proactive in implementing renewable energy initiatives, while Russia’s focus remains on fossil fuel extraction.
- **Conclusion**:
    
    - Both Russian and Western approaches to Arctic development can be critiqued through the lens of green colonialism.
    - Western states generally focus more on environmental protection and Indigenous rights, though their policies are not without criticism.
    - Russia tends to prioritize resource extraction, often at the expense of genuine environmental protection and Indigenous inclusion.
    - As climate change impacts intensify in the Arctic, the need for a truly sustainable and equitable approach becomes more urgent.
