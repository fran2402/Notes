- Any fairly small natural object from interplanetary space that survives its passage through a planet atmosphere and hits the surface
**Traditional classification**
- Stony
	- Chondrites $\leftarrow$ primitive planetesimal
	- Achondrites $\leftarrow$ crust
- Iron $\leftarrow$ core
- Stony-iron $\leftarrow$ core/mantle interface (boundary or mixture)
**Modern classification**
- Undifferentiated
	- Chondrites $\leftarrow$ abundance of elements very similar to the photosphere
- Differentiates
	- Achondrites
	- Iron $\leftarrow$ classified by $\mathrm{Ni}$ abundance
	- Stony-iron
**Tektities**
- Glassy objects
- Melt products of terrestrial rocks
- Formed by hyper-velocity impacts
**Fall phenomenons**
- To make it to the ground depends on $v_{\mathrm{init}}, \theta$, composition
- Average pressure on the leading face of a meteor: $$P \approx \frac{C_D\rho_g v^2}{2}$$
- Meteor slowed down by $P$ and accelerated by gravity: $$\frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt}=-\frac{C_D\rho_g v A}{2m}\mathbf{v}-g_p\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$
- If $P$ larger than compressive tensile strength of the meteor $\rightarrow$ break-up
- Iron very cohesive, broader range of sizes reaches the surface
**Age dating**
- Using half-life $t_{1/2}$ $\rightarrow$ radionuclide dating
- Taking multiple samples of the meteorite and identify daughter species: $$N_d(t)=N_d(t_0)+\xi(1-e^{-(t-t_0)/t_m})N_p(t_0)$$
- Yields absolute ages $\rightarrow$ fraction of parent nuclei remains in the rock
**Meteorites & Planet formation**
- Not subject to high heats
- Provide detailed info about environmental conditions of processes during planet formation
- Age of the solar system
- Achondrites and iron meteorites provide differentiation time
