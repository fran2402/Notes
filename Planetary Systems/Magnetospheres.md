- Can be induced by ***internal magnetic fields*** or by the ***presence of conduction***
**Solar wind**
- Originating from coronal holes
- Composed primarily from $p^0$ and $e^-$, and $4\% \textrm{ He}$ 
- Accelerated due to the ***pressure gradient***
- **Parker wind model**
	- Solving the continuity equation and momentum equation gives multiple wind solutions - only one valid
**Space weather**
- Communication disruption
- Change in $\mathbf{B}_E$ 
- Damage to transformers in power grids 
**Dynamo**
- Differential rotation in a fluid generating ***[[torodial fields]]***
- Convection creates ***[[poloidal fields]]***
**Induced**
- Ionosphere interaction
- Crustal magnetization
	- [Bow shocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_shock)
**Magnetopause**
- Ram pressure solar wind = pressure inside magnetosphere $P_{sw}=P_m$ 
- Variable depending on solar activity
- Changes shape and intensity of [Van Allen Belts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt)
**Particle motions**
- Equation of motion for a particle in a magnetic field: $$m\frac{d^2\mathbf{r}}{dt^2}=q\frac{\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}}{c}$$
- ***McIlwain parameter*** (maximum distance of a magnetic field line to the center of the planet): $$
\mathcal{L} = \left(\frac{\mathcal{M}_B}{R^3B_e}\right)^{1/3}$$
- 3 adiabatic invariants:
	- Gyro motion $\rightarrow$ cause aurora
	- Bounce motion $\rightarrow$ cause aurora
	- Drift motion $\rightarrow$ cause ring current in the equatorial plane
- For particles drifting towards a planet, first and second adiabatic invariants are conserved (***not the drift motion!***)
**Radio emission**
- Cyclotron maser emission emitted by $\mathrm{keV}$ electrons in auroral regions of a planet
- Synchotron radiation from $\mathrm{MeV}$ electrons gyrating around $\mathbf{B}$ lines
**Exoplanets**
- Could be observable in Hot Jupiters, could be much larger than Jupiter's due to stellar proximity
