**Orbits**
- Mean $e\approx0.14$ 
- ***Kirkwood gaps***: unstable orbital resonances with Jupiter
**NEOs**
- Separated into 4 categories:
	- Amors
	- Apollos
	- Athens
	- Apohele
- Replenished from MBA
- Rich in $\mathrm{C}$, $\mathrm{N}$, organic compounds $\rightarrow$ dominated by clay minerals
**Comparison to comets**
- If brought close to the Sun, volatile rich minor planets become comets
- If comets out-gas all near-surface volatiles and become dormant become minor planets
**Radius & Albedo**
- Very small angular sizes
- Amount of light reflected depends on size, distance, and albedo
	- Use of IR and optical luminosities to determine albedo $\rightarrow$ radiometry
	- In IR brightness corresponds to size
**Shape**
- Photometric lightcurves
- Brightness changes related to the shape (assume constant albedo)
- Lightcurve variations due to elongation are more symmetric
- Compare reflected and re-emitted IR radiation:
	- Elongated: both components will peak at the same time
	- Differences in albedo: dark side warmer and emits more IR
- If close enough to Earth, use radio waves
**Composition**
- Use of spectra composition and type
- Reflectance spectra presumably represent the surface composition
- Overall composition difficult due to weathering
- ***C-type*** (primitive) $\rightarrow$ dark bodies/flat spectra. low $T$, primitive objects
- ***S-type*** (igneous) $\rightarrow$  siliceous type, bright
- ***D- and P-type*** $\rightarrow$  very dark, red color, organic compounds, likely primitive
- ***M-type*** (metamorphic) $\rightarrow$ stony-iron or iron asteroid, metallic, lack of silicate features
**Size distribution**
- Characteristic distribution resulting from an evolution due to collisions and fragmentation
- Steeper slope for larger objects due to population evolving collisionally 
- Steady state valid only for small objects
**Families**
- Fragments of a single asteroid
- Break off with small random velocities and spread out along the original orbit
- Similar spectral properties
- Provide new NEOs
