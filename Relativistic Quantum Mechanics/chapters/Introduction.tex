Throughout the course \textsf{natural units} will be used

  \begin{equation}
    c = \hbar = 1,

making [L] = [T] and [Mass] = [Energy]. This means that the speed of light $c$ and the reduced Planck constant $\hbar$ are set to unity. This is a common practice in high energy physics and quantum field theory. The units of length, time and mass are then expressed in terms of energy. The consequence of this is when short scales are probed, high energies are needed.
